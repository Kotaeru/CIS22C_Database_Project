Told me that you're doin' wrong
Word out shockin' all alone
Cryin' wolf ain't like a man
Throwin' rocks to hide your hands
You ain't done enough for me
You ain't done enough for me
You are disgustin' me, yeah yeah
You're aiming just for me
You are disgustin' me
Just want your cut from me
But too bad, too bad
Look who just walked in the place
Dead and stuffy in the face
Look who's standing if you please
Though you tried to bring me to my knees
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Hell all up in Hollywood
Sayin' that you got it good
Creepin' from a dusty hole
Tales of what somebody told
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
Tired of you haunting me, yeah yeah
You're aiming just for me
You are disgustin' me
You got blood lust for me
But too bad, too bad
Look who got slapped in the face
It's dead and stuffy in the place
I'm right back where I wanna be
I'm standin' though you're kickin' me
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Life's about a dream
I'm really undefeated when MJ is on my team, theme
Reality brings forth realizm
It's the man of steel organizm, twizm
Not from the prizm, take charge like manilla
Nine five shaq represent with the Thrilla
Grab my crotch, twist my knee, then I'm through
Mike's bad, I'm bad
Who are you
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it;


2,000 Watts; 20011031; Invincible; cannot find studio; 78,649 views; no; 
Bass note, treble, stereo control, how low you go
Just enough to make your juices flow
Press play, don't stop, rotate, too hot
You feel I'm real
I'm everything you need, so tell me what's the deal
Two thousand watts, eight ohms, two hundred volts, real strong
Too much of that, fuse blown
Be careful what you say don't overload
Two thousand watts, eight ohms, two hundred volts, real strong
Too much of that, fuse blown
Be careful what you say don't overload
3D, high speed, feedback, Dolby
Release two or three, when I reach I can go 'til I hit my peak
Compact steelo, chico, D-Lo, highpost lady
Shorty really want to be there for me
Two thousand watts, eight ohms, two hundred volts, real strong
Too much of that, fuse blown
Be careful what you say don't overload
Two thousand watts, eight ohms, two hundred volts, real strong
Too much of that, fuse blown
Be careful what you say don't overload;

Everybody look around
'Cause there's a reason to rejoice you see
Everybody come out

Everybody look up
And feel the hope that we've been waiting for

And show the world that we've got liberty

It's such a change

Beat It; 19830218; Thriller; cannot find studio; 287,084,568 views; 4:58; yes; 
They told him don't you ever come around here
Don't want to see your face, you better disappear
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it
You better run, you better do what you can
Don't want to see no blood, don't be a macho man
You want to be tough, better do what you can
So beat it, but you want to be bad
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it, beat it
Just beat it, beat it
Just beat it, beat it
Just beat it, beat it
They're out to get you, better leave while you can
Don't want to be a boy, you want to be a man
You want to stay alive, better do what you can
So beat it, just beat it
You have to show them that you're really not scared
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare
They'll kick you, then they beat you,
Then they'll tell you it's fair
So beat it, but you want to be bad
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight

Ben; 19720804; Ben; studio not found; 6,807 views; 2:47; yes; 
Ben, the two of us need look no more
We both found what we were looking for
With a friend to call my own
I'll never be alone, and you, my friend, will see
You've got a friend in me
Ben, you're always running here and there
You feel you're not wanted anywhere
If you ever look behind and don't like what you find
There's something you should know, you've got a place to go
I used to say I and me, now it's us, now it's we
I used to say I and me, now it's us, now it's we
Ben most people would turn you away
I don't listen to a word they say
They don't see you as I do
I wish they would try to'
I'm sure they'd think again if they had a friend like Ben
A friend like Ben
(Like Ben)
Like Ben;

Billie Jean; 19830102; Thriller; Westlake Audio (Los Angeles); 345,298,606 views; 4:55; yes; 
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice, don't think twice)
She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no!)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one,
(You know what you did, (she says he is my son)breaking my heart babe)
She says I am the one
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover (don't Billie Jean)
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover;


Black Or White; 19911111; Dangerous; studio not found; 212,198,453 views; 6:22; yes; 

I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy is that girl with you 
Yes we're one and the same
Now I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight
But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
They print my message in the Saturday Sun
I had to tell them I ain't second to none
And I told about equality and it's true
Either you're wrong or you're right
But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
Sew when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain'ts scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Girl when the goin' gets mean
Protection 
For gangs, clubs, and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races
Just places
Faces
Where your blood comes from
Is were your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color
Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye
But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinkin' of being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinkin' of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white
Ooh, ooh
Yea, yea, yea now
Ooh, ooh
Yea, yea, yea now
It's black, it's white
It's tough for them to get by
It's black, it's white, (x3) whoo;

She got your number
She know your game
She put you under
It's so insane
Since you seduced her
How does it feel
To know that woman
Is out to kill
Every night stance is like takin' a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you're gonna get it
Every hot man is out takin' a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you do regret it
To escape the world I've got to enjoy that simple dance
And it seemed that everything was on my side
(Blood on my side)
She seemed sincere like it was love and true romance
And now she's out to get me
And I just can't take it
Just can't break it
Susie got your number
And Susie ain't your friend
Look who took you under
With seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor
Blood is on the knife
Susie's got your number
And Susie says its right
She got your number
How does it feel
To know this stranger
Is out to kill
She got your baby
It happened fast
If you could only
Erase the past
Every night stance is like takin a chances
It's not about love and romance
And now you're gonna get it
Every hot man is out takin' a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you do regret it
To escape the world I got to enjoy this simple dance
And it seemed that everything was on my side
(Blood on my side)
It seemed sincere like it was love and true romance
And now she's out to get me
And I just can't take it
Just can't break it
Susie got your number

Look who took you under
With seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor
Blood is on the knife
Susie got your number
You know Susie says its right
Susie's got your number
Susie ain't your friend
Look who took you under
She put seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor
Blood is on the knife 
Susie's got your number 
Susie says its right
It was blood on the dance floor
(blood on the dance floor)
It was blood on the dance floor
(blood on the dance floor)
It was blood on the dance floor
(blood on the dance floor)
It was blood on the dance floor
(blood on the dance floor)
And I just can't take it
The girl won't break it

All you gotta do is walk away and pass me by
Don't acknowledge my smile when I try to say hello to you, yeah
And all you gotta do is not answer my calls when
I'm trying to get through
To keep me wondering why, when all I can do is sigh
I just want to touch you
I just want to touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I
All I gotta say is that I must be dreaming, can't be real
You're not here with me, still I can feel you near me
I caress you, let you taste us, just so blissful listen
I would give you anything baby, just make my dreams come true
Oh baby you give me butterflies
I just want to touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I
I just want to touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I
If you would take my hand, baby I would show you
Guide you to the light babe
If you would be my love, baby I will love you, love you
'Til the end of time
I just want to touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I
I just want to touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I
I just want to touch and kiss

Call On Me; 19840515; Farewell My Summer Love; Studio not found; 210 views; 3:39; no; 
There goes the sunshine
Here comes the rain
And heartache things
What can I do but wait for you
Darling the days
I had looked cold
Now our separate ways we go
It seems you want more
Than the love I can give
But I can't make you stay
And you got your life to live
But if it gets too rough
Call on me
Dreams of golden glare
Taking you away from here
But if ever think that has to be
Turns your dreams around
Love and understanding is what you need
If you can't get enough
Call on me
I'm so sad you're leaving
It's going to kill me
Not to be with you? 
But I want you to be happy
If parting is what you want
Then I want it too
So goodbye with all my best
For your happiness in a world that's there
Should you write and it's not there
Call on me
(Call on me)
Yes, happiness
Wish you for elsewhere
We remember this should
You write and it's not there
Call on me, call on me
Yes, happiness
Wish you for elsewhere
We remember this should
You write and it's not there
Call on me;
